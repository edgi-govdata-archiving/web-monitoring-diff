Release History

In Development: v0.1.0
----------------------

This project used to be a part of `web-monitoring-processing <https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing/>`_, which contains a wide variety of libraries, scripts, and other tools for working with data across all the various parts of EDGIâ€™s Web Monitoring project. The goal of this initial release is to create a new, more focused package containing the diff-releated tools so they can be more easily used by others.
