# Data from different sources

## Data Sources
* Internet Archive
* PageFreezer
* Versionista

### Internet Archive
The original response from the Internet Archive is a list of 'mementos'(or 'versions', as we call them). Each line contains information about a version. At times, a line may be a 'TimeMap', which is essentially a link to the next list of mementos.


`source_metadata` : Byte sequences containing information separated by semi-colons of each version stored in Internet Archive. 
We extract the useful information i.e. the date and uri from each memento.

Example :
`b'<http://web.archive.org/web/19970711094601/http://www.nasa.gov:80/>; rel="memento"; datetime="Fri, 11 Jul 1997 09:46:01 GMT",'`

### PageFreezer

Unlike Internet Archive, where the URL directly leads to 'mementos'('versions') of it, PageFreezer requires the Id of the cabinet the URL belongs to and then leads to the archives and 'files'('versions') to be retrieved. 

`source_metadata` : PageFreezer gives the option of retrieving either the metadata(header/internal info) or the file itself.

The file metadata is returned as a JSON blob which has the following fields:
- `archive` : The Id of the archive where the version is stored. PageFreezer uses the timestamp as the archive Id.
- `cabinet` : The Id of the cabinet in which this version is stored.
-  `elapsed` : Time elapsed during retrieval of the file details.
-  `file` : Another JSON blob with info about the file.
    - `ContentType` : The type of the content in the file.
   - `Data`:  
   - `Depth`: 
   - `ElapsedSec`: Time elapsed during retrieval of the metadata contents.
   - `Header`: Details about the server it is hosted on, the file Id and hash on the server, timestamp, content length, and web security policies and mechanisms. This represents the meta tags in the HTML file.
   - `Links`: A list of the different components (theme, widget etc.) of a webpage in the form of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains details of the URL to a component of the webpage.
   - `OnlyRedirect` : Tells us whether the page only contains redirect information. `True` or `False`
   - `PageId` : Id associated with the page.
   - `StartedAt` : The time at which the metadata retrieval was started.
   - `Status` : Retrieval request response status. Typicall `200 OK`.
   - `StatusCode` : Just the status code. Typically `200`
   - `TaskId` : 
   - `Timestamp` : The time at which the archive was loaded.
   - `Url0` : The URL of the page itself. 
   - `Url1`: 
   - `UrlType`: 
   - `Writeflag`: 
- `key`: Each file is associated with a key.
- `status` : API call response status.
